# the_movies
You will need to place the database connection file named 'movies_mysqli_connect.php' one directory above/outside from 'the_movies' project folder for security reasons. Both the 'view_movies.php' and 'add_movies.php' scripts will be using this file in order to connect with the database.

Likewise the database file is included in the project folder, be sure to import it into your relevant mysql compatible database management application/tool so that you can begin using it. In this example we used phpmyadmin which came with wampserver, so if you wish to replicate you may also download and install wampserver so that you can import it using phpmyadmin if you so wish to. Alternatively feel free to import the mysql databse via the command line interface.
